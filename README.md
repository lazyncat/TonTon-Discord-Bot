# TonTon Discord Bot

## About the project
This bot was created as a personal project to learn C# and use my knowledge to piece together a bot.
Most of the code used here was created and taught by [Coding With Efehan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP2ZC3P_goEECplHlebT6aQ).
I do not intend to release this bot to the public.
